        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>The title 'All-American Girls Professional Baseball League' or AAGPBL, was not used at first, but rather concerning the topic
        of softball. The group had started in 1943, by Philip K. Wrigley, oddly enough a man. The league consisted of eager females who
        would die for the sport, thus the team's saying "Do or Die". The team died down back in 1954, but it will be remembered in the Hall of Fame. </p>
