			<h3>Plot</h3>
				<p>Cuphead is a run and gun indie game, revolving around two brothers who've found themselves in a life or death situation because of their greed.
			It was released in September of 2017, and has already taken gamers's attention with its 1930's cartoon style, bright colors, and overall amazing soundtrack and plot.</p>
				<p>The plot is two brothers, Cuphead and Mugman, had run off playing one day and found themselves at the Devil's Casino where they go on a winning streak at the craps table.
			Eventually, they catch the eye of the Devil himself and he makes a deal with them: If they win, Cuphead and Mugman get all of the Devil's riches. If they lose however, the Devil gets their soul.
			They roll and get snake eyes, successfully losing their souls to the Devil. They beg him relentlessly until the Devil agrees to let their souls go if they can collect the soul contracts of all runaway debtors in 24 hours. The game follows the two brothers as they fight
			debtors (bosses) using finger guns.</p>
